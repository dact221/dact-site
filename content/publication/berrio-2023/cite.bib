    abstract = {The installation of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays near the coast can have significant impacts on sediment dynamics and coastal morphodynamics. However, methodologies for quantifying these impacts and strategies to minimize them are still in need of development. In this study, we assessed the coastal response to a WEC array on the La Guajira coast in the Colombian Caribbean using a two-step numerical strategy. We used the Delft-3D model to estimate the wave field, which was then transferred to the XBeach model to compute morphological changes. This modelling strategy was applied to three WEC array layouts and compared the morphological responses in terms of the distance and relative orientation of the WEC array to the coast. The results showed that the impact of the simulated WEC array on the beach response varied significantly depending on its distance from the coast, the configuration of the array, and its orientation. These findings highlight the need for further research to develop effective strategies for minimizing coastal erosion impacts on coastal ecosystems through innovative alternatives. Developing such strategies will be crucial to ensure the sustainable implementation of WEC arrays and other renewable energy technologies near the coast.}
