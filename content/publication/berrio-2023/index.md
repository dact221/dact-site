abstract: 'The installation of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays near the coast can have
  significant impacts on sediment dynamics and coastal morphodynamics. However, methodologies
  for quantifying these impacts and strategies to minimize them are still in need of development.
  In this study, we assessed the coastal response to a WEC array on the La Guajira coast in the
  Colombian Caribbean using a two-step numerical strategy. We used the Delft-3D model to estimate
  the wave field, which was then transferred to the XBeach model to compute morphological changes.
  This modelling strategy was applied to three WEC array layouts and compared the morphological
  responses in terms of the distance and relative orientation of the WEC array to the coast. The
  results showed that the impact of the simulated WEC array on the beach response varied
  significantly depending on its distance from the coast, the configuration of the array, and
  its orientation. These findings highlight the need for further research to develop effective
  strategies for minimizing coastal erosion impacts on coastal ecosystems through innovative
  alternatives. Developing such strategies will be crucial to ensure the sustainable implementation
  of WEC arrays and other renewable energy technologies near the coast.'
