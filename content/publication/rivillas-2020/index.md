abstract: From a comprehensive diagnosis of the associated basins, islands, and wetlands
  of the coastal lagoon system of Ci&eacute;naga Grande de Santa Marta, Colombia,
  this work describes feasible options for the recovery of its ecosystem&rsquo;s health
  and ecological resilience. Firstly, the state of the coastal lagoon was assessed,
  finding that hydrology, wave climate, and the morphological changes of the coastline
  explain recent changes in the coastal wetlands. Key variables were used to describe
  the level of conservation or degradation of the coastal lagoon system and to identify
  measures to improve its ecological functions. Finally, to mimic some of these functions
  and improve connectivity of the ecosystems, green infrastructure alternatives were
  proposed for the short and medium term to recover the services of these ecosystems
  and restore their resilience.
