abstract: 'This work presents APPMAR 1.0, an application written in the Python programming
  language that downloads, processes, and analyzes wind and wave data. This application
  is composed of a graphical user interface (GUI) that contains two main modules:
  the first module downloads data from WAVEWATCH III® (WW3) production hindcasts by
  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); the second module applies
  statistical mathematics for processing and analyzing wave and wind data. This application
  provides useful graphical results that describe mean and extreme wave and wind climate.
  APPMAR generates plots of exceedance probability, joint probability distribution,
  wave direction, Weibull distribution, and storm frequency analysis. Currently, APPMAR
  only downloads and analyzes wave and wind data from WW3 hindcasts, but it is under
  development to other datasets and marine climate parameters. This application has
  been tested in the Magdalena River mouth, Colombia, and Cancún, México, where observational
  wave and wind data are scarce.'
